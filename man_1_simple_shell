NAME
	Janky Shell - a UNIX Shell look-alike

SYNOPSIS
	Janky Shell is a custom-built shell, designed to mirror some of the features contained in the UNIX Shell program. It was built as the final project in the C component of Holberton's Software Engineering course.

DESCRIPTION
	Janky Shell immitates most of the basic features of the Shell program, including:
	- system calls
	- system calls with arguments
	- the exit and env built-in commands
	- support for interactive and non-interactive modes

OPTIONS
	Some of the commands on offer include:
	- mkdir: create a folder in the current directory
	- ls (-l, -a, etc): lists all folders and files in current directory
	- rm: deletes specified file
	- env: prints user's current environment to stdout
	Janky Shell can also be used in non-interactive mode. For example, echo "ls" | ./hsh will pipe the 'ls' command into Janky Shell, resulting in a list of all files and folders in the current directory being printed to stdout.

BUGS
	Non-detected
