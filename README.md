# Holberton school simple shell project
## (aka: Janky Shellâ„¢)

Janky Shell is a custom-built shell look-alike, designed to mirror some of the features contained in the UNIX Shell program. It was built as the final project in the C component of Holberton's Software Engineering course. It was built in two days and after more than a week of climbing mountains in New Zealand; as such, it is not great. We hope you enjoy.

## Key features
- the ability to handle all system calls that come standard in the UNIX Shell program
- argument handling for more granular control of these system calls
- shell built in commands:
	- env: displays user's environment
	- exit: exits Janky Shell
- support for interactive and non-interactive modes
